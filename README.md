Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit Testing 🧩
Focuses on testing individual components (units) of code, such as functions, classes, or modules.
Typically performed by developers using frameworks like JUnit (Java), PyTest (Python), or Jest (JavaScript).

 Importance:
Catches bugs early before they spread to other parts of the system.
Helps maintain code reliability and stability.
Speeds up debugging by pinpointing exactly where an issue exists.

 Example:
Testing a function that calculates a user’s total shopping cart price to ensure it returns the correct sum.

2. Integration Testing 
Tests how different units/modules work together to ensure smooth interaction.
Identifies issues related to data flow, API communication, and dependencies between components.

 Importance:
Ensures that different parts of the system communicate correctly.
Detects incompatibility issues between modules early.
Prevents issues where components work individually but fail when combined.

 Example:
Testing the integration between a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal) and an e-commerce checkout system to ensure transactions process correctly.

3. System Testing 
Tests the entire system to verify that it meets functional and non-functional requirements.
Includes performance, security, usability, and reliability testing.

 Importance:
Ensures the software behaves as expected in a real-world environment.
